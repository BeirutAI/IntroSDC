# Intro to self-driving cars

Self-driving vehicles are cars or trucks in which human drivers are never required to take control to safely operate the vehicle. Also known as autonomous or ‚Äúdriverless‚Äù cars, they combine sensors and software to control, navigate, and drive the vehicle.

This workshop will be divided to 2 parts, the first one is a presentation about the lessons learned from taking Udacity's Self Driving car nano degree and the second part is a hands-on coding lab on object detection, mainly applied to detect moving cars on the road.

The presentation slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LRu25TIPmHoMVo50_M-qBZ74Za8j6iwni4-je43ECQ0/edit?usp=sharing)
